COVID 19 REST API
Last day I have passed my time making a REST API service for CoVID-19 daily update. The reason I have made this service is to save time for application developers who are facing challenges to get CoVID-19 live data.
Science, worldometers.info is not providing any counter or API  service for CoVID-19 daily updates currently and a few developer friends of mine looking for the same API, so I decided to wrap it up. 
But the problem is, as their policy, using worldometer's data without permission is illegal. So I will upgrade the service after worldometers.info publishes their CoVID-19 API.
Until then, the RESTful service is already deployed and ready to use. The endpoints are bellow

GET ALL DATA
http://covid-rest.herokuapp.com/

GET BY COUNTRY NAME
http://covid-rest.herokuapp.com/{country_name}

GET SUMMARY
http://covid-rest.herokuapp.com/summary

Furthermore, this project is opensource and your collaboration is appreciable.
